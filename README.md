#### #Opensource Project to set up a Three-tier Architecture in AWS using Terraform & official AWS modules. 
##### Introduction

In this #opensource project we will be sharing the experience of creating a Three-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform ([LAMP stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html)). All AWS Infrastructure implementation was done using offcial AWS Terraform modules.  The project aimed to create a scalable, secure, and high-performing web application environment. <br/>
For Terraform users, the [Terraform Registry enables](https://registry.terraform.io/) the distribution of Terraform modules, which are reusable configurations. The Terraform Registry acts as a centralized repository for module sharing, making modules easier to discover and reuse. This project utilizes the offical Terraform modules<br/>

##### Overall learnings
- `Terraform Automation`: Experience the efficiency of infrastructure-as-code using Terraform. Rapidly deploy the complex Cloud architectures with ease.<br/>
- Terraform structure and naming conventions & variable declarations <br/>
- `Modular Flexibility`: Understand the efficiency & productivity of official AWS Terraform modules, enabling seamless customization and easy integration with 
  specific needs. The DRY and KISS principles incorporated in the official AWS Terraform modules contribute to modular design and consistent approach. With 
  reusable building blocks, development teams can create complex cloud infrastructures while maintaining a clean, uncluttered codebase.<br/>
- `Clean code and reusable code in Terraform`. Leveraged [official Terraform Modules](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-modules-on-aws) instead of 
   reinventing the wheel <br/>
- `Handling sensitive data in Terraform modules like secret key, access key and passwords` <br/> 
- [Terraform remote state using AWS S3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) and [state locking using Dynamodb](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration). To ensure the reliability and consistency of AWS infrastructure :- have implemented state storage in AWS S3 and DynamoDB. This provides with a secure and scalable mechanism for storing and retrieving critical state information.<br/>
- `DRY and KISS principles of software development` : The official AWS Terraform modules in the Terraform Registry adhere to the DRY principle, promoting code 
   reusability and minimizing duplication enabling development teams to avoid repetition and consolidate their infrastructure codebase efficiently. When the 
   codebase is DRY then its easier to maintain and scale. The modules also adhere to KISS principles (systems work best if they are kept simple rather than 
   complicated). Simplicity and elegance are core of the official AWS Terraform modules.  The modules encapsulate complex AWS resource configurations into 
   easy-to-use interfaces, where users only need to provide a few inputs to create or manage an AWS resource. These principles (DRY & KISS) are widely used in 
   the software development and are effective in improving code quality and reducing errors.  <br/>

##### Project Overview

A Three-tier architecture is a widely adopted approach for building scalable web applications. It separates the application into three layers: presentation, application logic, and database. In this project, we utilized AWS services to create these layers and ensure scalability and high availability. <br/>

To build our three-tier architecture, we leveraged various AWS services. These included the use of [official AWS Terraform modules](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-modules-on-aws) for VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), ALB, ASG, RDS , security groups, and more. There are quite a few benefits & advantages to refer and use official Terraform modules (or open source modules). The value (benefits/advantages) can be passed on to customers & project teams. Some of them are :<br/>
    - `Rapid Deployment and Scalability` : The well-documented modules abstracts away all the complexity of setting AWS resources - customers can experience a  
      seamless and swift setup for their AWS architectures. The modules provide a standardized foundation, streamlining the deployment process and reducing the chances of 
      errors or inconsistencies.<br/>
    - `Modular approach & best practices for AWS Architecture` : By utilizing official AWS Terraform modules - the architecture benefits from tested and well-maintained 
       code that follows AWS best practices. These modules also allow different teams to work independently on specific parts of the system without interfering with each 
       other. We have the benefit of using battle-tested, production-hardened code without having to write it ourselves (we can modify it as required to build in-hosue 
      modules very easily).<br/>
    - `Scalability & Learnings for the teams` : Modules in [official Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) are great since developers and customers 
       can now draw from the knowledge of the community that has already developed battle-tested modules. Moreover,  the “HashiCorp Verified Modules” means they are vetted 
       and actively maintained and gives extra confidence. These modules can also be easily extended & opinionated to build in-house modules (instead of starting from 
       scratch).Lastly, people from non-development background can also learn & work easily. They don’t need to know how a module works (or complex programming) to be able 
       to use a module; they just have to know how to set inputs and outputs. <br/>
    - `Automation-first mindset`: By following a turn-key approach & leveraging pre-built official modules organizations can prioritze automating tasks wherever possible 
        thereby increasing efficiency throughout. These modules are designed to be used out of the box, with minimal configuration needed to match specific use case. 
        (where-ever required customers can easily create in-house modules because the official modules provide a very convenient starting point).<br/>
    - `Security-First approach/mindset`: By leveraging the official AWS Terraform modules, customers benefit from industry-standard security practices which AWS 
        recommends. <br/>
    - `Simplicity & consitency`: The official Terraform modules provide a significant level of convenience, pre-configuration & and consistent patterns for 
        infrastructure provisioning which helps accelerate the development and deployment process. <br/>
    - `Documentation and versioning` : these remote modules are very well documented and versioned. Anyone new can easily scale up & be productive at the earliest.<br/>
    -  `Cost optimization & benefits which can be passed to customers` : AWS Terraform modules are designed to leverage AWS services in an optimized manner.  Official 
        Terraform AWS modules helps reduce efforts and costs of implementation which can be passed to customers. We can save a lot of time by using these open source 
        modules instead of writing comparable code ourselves; all it takes is learning how to use the module interface. Official modules are widely used and well- 
        maintained, they are tested and validated for functionality and compatibility, saving development costs and avoiding potential issues down the line. All these 
        benefits can be passed to customers<br/>
    
##### Project Setup and Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary permissions <br/>
- [Terraform installed on local machine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) <br/>
- [AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) <br/>
- Create a bucket in AWS S3 pass it to parameter `bucket` in file `backend.tf` <br/>
- Create a `Dynamodb` table with default values and `Partition key` as `LockID` and pass the table name to parameter `dynamodb_table` in file `backend.tf`<br/>
- Please verify and update the AMI id in terraform.tfvars file. AWS changes the value frequently. So please go to EC2 console and check the AMI for `Amazon Linux 2` for 
  the region you choose and update the value. In demo the region is `us-west-2` and the AMI is for `Amazon Linux 2` as of today.<br/>
- Download/Clone the source code and run 'terraform init/plan/validate/apply'

<br/>

##### Architecture Design

**Web Tier** <br/>
The Web tier is responsible for handling client traffic. We deployed Amazon EC2 servers in a private subnet to host the web servers. It was accessible through an Application Load Balancer (ALB). <br/>

**Application Tier** <br/>
The Application tier consists of one or more EC2 instances deployed in a private subnet. We installed the necessary application components (e.g., PHP) on these instances.<br/>

**Database Tier** <br/>
The Database tier used Amazon RDS for MySQL. It was deployed in a private subnet to ensure security. <br/>

**Terraform Configuration** <br/>

The Terraform configuration was organized into different modules for VPC, EC2, ALB, RDS, and security groups. [Official AWS Terraform modules are used](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-modules-on-aws) to create the entire infrastructure. <br/><br/>
[Modularization](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/modules/module) : This project is fully based on near turn-key modules. The best part is that it can also be used to [create opinionated modules very easily because these modules gives a very convinient starting point](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/opinionated-terraform-best-practices-and-anti-patterns). Valuable modules are the ones that are configurable and provide reusable building blocks. Customers should decide how things should be done and create a module to implement their own preferred approach. This project can serve as guide for the same.<br/>

With Terraform's declarative syntax, we were able to define our infrastructure as code. We created configuration files that specified the desired state of our AWS resources, including VPC, RDS database, security groups, and more. Terraform then took care of provisioning and managing these resources in a repeatable and consistent manner. The Terraform modules are elaborated below with benefits.

If required we can also add a module folder and shift the respective resources tf files to that folder <br/>

**Handling sensitive data in Terraform modules** <br/>
It is never a good practice to store sensitive information, such as access keys and passwords, in Terraform configuration files, where they could easily be exposed and shared into different configuration plans than they were intended for. Instead, a good practice is to create a file named `secrets.tfvars` to hold sensitive data, and place it in the root module folder in the top-level directory. This file should never be tracked in Git. Put the `secrets.tfvars` in `.gitignore` file. Declare two variables `secret_key` and `access_key` in variables.tf file and then assign `secret_key` and `access_key` values in `secrets.tfvars` file. Once done then run the commands `terraform plan -var-file="secrets.tfvars" -var-file="terraform.tfvars"` and `terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars" -var-file="terraform.tfvars" -auto-approve`.

        named groups provide a convenient way to quickly set up commonly used security group rules.

##### Deployment Process
1. Once deployed, we accessed the application through the ALB's DNS name. <br/>
2. To access the admin page we navigated to < < ALB DNS > >/phpinfo.php

##### Best Practices
Other than what mentioned earlier - below are some practices followed during the project :

 - Terraform modules registry: The project leverages the [Official Terraform module registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) to find and apply pre-built modules to 
   provide a turn-key solutions. Other than this we can also use modules from the Terraform community. Open-source modules saves time, improves security, and give greater 
   confidence in project infrastructure. Importantly these reusable modules encourage best practices
 - [Modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop#standard-module-structure) : A Terraform module is a way of creating a template of a cloud 
   pattern, parameterizing, and reusing it. They are useful tools for promoting software abstraction and code reuse. Input variables (or Terraform variables, or just variables) are user-supplied values that parametrize Terraform modules without altering the source code. This project is built on modules to increase code 
   reusability and decrease code redundancy. Modules breaks down complex configurations into smaller configs for reusability and maintainability. It 
   streamlines the provisioning and management of infrastructure, resulting in more efficient and dependable operations.
 - Leverage Official Open Source Modules : We fully leveraged open source modules provided freely by Hashicorp. This helps the team to scale faster as every developer   
   is likely to be familiar with an open source module (unlike bespoke modules) resulting new staff enrolment to be quicker. Another big advantage is that development team 
   now can easily create opinionated modules from these open source modules which can serve a specific purpose (instead of starting from scratch). If they think these open 
   source modules to be too broad they can create in-house opinionated modules for specific use case. Open-source modules are highly configurable & easy to make more 
   configurable.
 - Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) : One of the principles of software engineering is DRY (don’t repeat yourself). The same applies to IaC. In this project we 
   applied Modularization (official Terraform modules) to achieve DRY state.  
 - Remote state storage: The Terraform state files are stored in a remote location (AWS S3) to enable collaboration and ensure consistency.
 - This project uses proper naming conventions for resources to avoid naming conflicts.
 - Use version controls Git as single source of truth. We have stored Terraform configurations in a version control system (Github) to track changes and collaborate with 
   others.
 - Leverage variables.tf & terraform.tfvars files : Used variables to customize infrastructure and avoid hardcoding values in the configuration file. The naming 
   conventions were also consistent as official terraform modules were used. Variable.tf and terraform.tfvars files are excellent for externalizing 
   configurations and passing values so they can be easily deployed across multiple environments. Everything that’s not a secret was put in tfvars files for all 
   inputs and then put them in source control (Github). <br/>

##### Conclusion

Setting up a Three-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform & LAMP stack was an insightful & rewarding experience.  The combination of these technologies allowed us to achieve scalability, security, and reliability for our web application. It allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of AWS services and infrastructure as code practices. I hope this blog post inspires others to explore this architecture and its benefits.
